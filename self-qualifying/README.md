# Clarification on CV and Letters of Recommendation

In my formal application, I mentioned that my CV and letters of recommendation would be available in this repository. This section serves to clarify the status and location of these documents, with respect for their confidential requirements.

*   **CV and ICBC Recommendation Letter:**
    For your convenience, my CV and the recommendation letter from my time at ICBC Headquarters were attached to the initial inquiry email I sent previously on May 15th.

*   **KPMG Recommendation Letter:**
    The letter from my managers at KPMG Lighthouse was still being prepared at the time of our first contact, which is why it wasn't attached to that email. I'm happy to provide this letter upon request through a secure channel.

My goal in mentioning them was to give a complete picture of my qualifications. I'm trying to handle these sensitive materials while respecting professional and academic norms, thank you for your understanding.
