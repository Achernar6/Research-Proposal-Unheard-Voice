This folder contains a supplementary research proposal "*Unheard Voices, Market Signals*" which is designed to be read together with my main research proposal "*Simulating Financial Markets with Controllable Irrationality*" submitted for the Master's program.
This supplementary proposal details the descriptive, mechanical half of my broader research vision, while the primary proposal focuses on building a generative simulation, this plan outlines the essential empirical work required to ground that simulation in reality.

## Broader Research Vision
At the heart of my research agenda is a commitment to modeling the **latent factors** from the blind point of human ourselves that drive complex social and market behavior. This principle unites my submitted proposal and this supplementary one, both trying to approach this challenge from a constructive perspective:  
My submitted proposal (RP2) focuses on the **unseen dynamics of desire**—the cognitive threads that make sub-rational human decisions coherent and interpretable.
This supplementary proposal (RP1) explores the **unheard voices of the silent majority**—treating their silence not as an absence of data, but as a rich, alternative signal for market prediction.
Beyond sharing a common theme, these two research plans are designed to be methodologically synergistic. This supplementary project uploaded here (Unheard Voices) is intended to directly inform and validate the generative simulation in two main ways:
- **Quantitative Calibration:** This proposal outlines a holistic descriptive analysis of real-world data from both micro (individual) and macro (market/social) scales as well as  qualitative case analysis. The empirical benchmarks produced here will serve as the **quantitative calibration target** for the agent-based simulation in my main proposal, ensuring its outputs are verifyable with observed reality.
- **Informing Cognitive Architecture:** This study will identify and categorize the causal mechanisms behind different types of silence (e.g., conformity-driven vs. confidence-driven). These evidence-based mechanisms will directly inform the **design of the agent cognitive architecture** in my main proposal, providing realistic, data-grounded rules for how agents should adapt their reasoning and behavior in response to social and market pressures.

## Guidance for reviewing This proposal
Please review the full supplementary research proposal in this folder with the above context in mind.
As this is still a conceptual plan, I invite you to mainly focus on the background, research aim & questions sections, and the overall methodological structure, which demonstrate the project's strategic and directional foundation.
The detailed **technical implementations are preliminary and still need further careful curation.**

This research vision has been constantly, iteratively modified through out the past 6 months, as seen from our initial contact in the inquiry letter, to the entry sheet I submitted the second time for applying for Izumi Lab Information Session, and finally the submitted version in the system. **I hope this conveys not only my research vision but also my commitment and interest in this field**. Thank you for your time and consideration.
