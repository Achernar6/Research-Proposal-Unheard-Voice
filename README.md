# Supplementary Materials for Research Proposal Submission

This repository is a living supplement to my formal application submitted to the **Izumi Lab** of the University of Tokyo for the 2026 Master's Program intake.

This project represents a long-standing interest for me with several large revisions, and just before the deadline another significant breakthrough occurred (mainly about the reward-interpretation system), which led me to rapidly revise and submit my most current thoughts in the formal proposal. As a result, these supplementary materials are still in the process of best unfolding the final proposal.

I am actively refining the contents of this repository and will be updating them iteratively. My hope is to offer a transparent and thorough view of my research process and my deep commitment to this work.

## Guide to the Repository

This repository is actively being updated. I am currently in the process of refining the code prototypes, creating higher-fidelity figures, and further detailing the implementation plans. These updates will be committed iteratively.

To help navigate the materials in their current state, I have organized them as follows:

*   `self-qualifying/`: Contains my CV and letters of recommendation from my experience at KPMG and ICBC.

*   `submitted-rp-materials/`: Contains supplementary materials for the proposal you have reviewed. **(Note: These materials are undergoing refinement.)**
    *   `1_implementation_stages.md`: The planned stages of implementation.
    *   `2_figures_and_diagrams/`: Key figures and diagrams.
    *   `3_pseudo-code/`: Formal pseudo code for key cognitive processes.
    *   `4_citation_implications`: A table managing key citations and their specific implications for my research, part of my knowledge management workflow (and key technologhies' citations which hadn't been put on the submitted document due to space limit).

*   `serial-research-plan/`: the Unheard Voice full research plan and an abstract intro of the serial researches.
    *   `overall_abstract.md`: The abstract for the complete three-part research series.
    *   `part-1_unheard-voices/`: The complete research plan for the foundational "Unheard Voices" project mentioned in the submitted document.
    *   
## My Research Vision: A Three-Part Investigation

The project detailed in my formal submission, *"Simulating Financial Markets with Controllable Irrationality,"* is the culminating third part of a larger, multi-stage research plan[1]. The full vision is designed to bridge the gap between real-world observation and high-fidelity simulation:

*   **Part 1: The Foundation ("Unheard Voices")**. This initial research starts with a holistic descriptive analysis of the market and financial SNS to explore the mechanisms and predictive power of selective and complete silence among investors. The full research plan for this foundational stage is located in the `serial-research-plan/` directory. Its findings are supposed to serve as the empirical and quantitative research of real-world calibration for the final simulation.

*   **Part 2: The Bridge (Macro-level Proof)**. This is a conceptualized mediating stage to prove, from a macro perspective, that incorporating the "silent majority" has a quantifiable and significant impact on simulating market dynamics.

*   **Part 3: The Synthesis that leads to a new paradigm (Submitted Proposal)**. This is the research I have formally submitted. It builds upon the previous stages to construct a high-fidelity agent-based model where individual irrationality can be controlled and studied at micro level and calibrated from a macro level.

Thank you again for the opportunity to present these additional details. I am deeply enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to the Izumi Lab, as well as exploring the possibility of realizing what I've been persuing.

Sincerely,

Jietong Li
